## Technical Implementation

### Backend API Endpoints

**Created Routes** (`/api/goals`):
- `POST /goals` - Create a single goal
- `POST /goals/bulk` - Create multiple goals at once
- `GET /goals` - Get all goals with filters (date range, exercise type, status)
- `GET /goals/today` - Get today's goals
- `GET /goals/exercise/{type}` - Get today's goal for specific exercise
- `GET /goals/{id}` - Get a specific goal
- `PUT /goals/{id}` - Update a goal (progress, target, status)
- `DELETE /goals/{id}` - Delete a goal
- `GET /goals/stats/summary` - Get monthly statistics

### Database Schema

**Goal Model**:
```python
{
    "user_id": string,
    "exercise_type": "pushup" | "squat",
    "target_count": integer,
    "date": date,
    "completed_count": integer,
    "status": "pending" | "in_progress" | "completed" | "missed",
    "created_at": datetime,
    "updated_at": datetime
}
```

**Automatic Status Management**:
- `pending`: Goal not started (completed_count = 0)
- `in_progress`: Some progress made (0 < completed_count < target_count)
- `completed`: Goal achieved (completed_count >= target_count)
- `missed`: Past date with incomplete goal

### Frontend Components

## User Flow

## Best Practices

### For Users
- **Start Small**: Begin with achievable targets (10-20 push-ups, 15-25 squats)
- **Be Consistent**: Set goals for multiple days per week
- **Progressive Overload**: Gradually increase targets over time
- **Rest Days**: Don't set goals every day to allow recovery
- **Track Progress**: Review monthly completion rates

### For Developers
- **Timezone Handling**: Goals use date objects (not datetime) to avoid timezone issues
- **Validation**: Backend validates that target_count > 0
- **Duplicate Prevention**: Cannot create multiple goals for same exercise/date
- **Auth Required**: All goal endpoints require authentication
- **Error Handling**: Frontend gracefully handles API failures

## Future Enhancements

Potential features to add:
1. **Monthly Reminder System**: Alert users at the start of each month to set new goals
2. **Copy Previous Month**: Option to duplicate last month's goal schedule
3. **Goal Templates**: Preset goal patterns (e.g., "Beginner 30-day plan")
4. **Streak Tracking**: Count consecutive days of goal completion
5. **Social Features**: Share achievements with friends
6. **Analytics**: Detailed progress charts and insights
7. **Notifications**: Remind users about incomplete daily goals
8. **Custom Exercises**: Allow users to set goals for any exercise type
9. **Weekly Goals**: In addition to daily goals
10. **Goal History**: View and analyze past month's performance
